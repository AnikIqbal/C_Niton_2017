# C Niton 2017
<em>This repository contains the source code of the book "Sobar Jonno C" by Kamruzzaman Niton.</em>

<strong>TO BE NOTICED</strong>

  * The source code was originally written for Turbo C++ IDE so the source code is modified to meet the requirements of modern compilers such as GCC, Clang.
  * Some strings are changed to my own likings but the end goal is kept same.
  * The codes are made portable as possible.
  * There may be additional text files(.txt) which cover useful information.

<em><strong>Compiled using GCC 6.2.0 on Ubuntu 17.04 64-Bit</em></strong>
